# Sequence analysis tools

Sequence analysis tools will provide base and advance sequence ( DNA and protein) manipulation in R environment, reference the features implementation in [SMS](http://www.detaibio.com/sms2/group_dna.html), [SeqTools](http://www.biossc.de/seqool/index.html). The features include:

1. basic Statistic 
   - sequence length composition: N50, N90 et.
   - codon statistic: codon usage, codon preference
   - nucleotide composition statistic: GC%, base%(A,T,C,G,R,....), oligo composition, and restriction site, over- or under-presented oligo
2. Search
3. Extraction
4. manipulation
